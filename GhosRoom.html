                <span class="textcontent">ความคิดริเริ่มสร้างสรรค์แต่เดิมทีมาจากความสนใจในการทำเกมเกี่ยวกับ visual novel
                    ที่เป็นเกมแนวที่เน้นไปที่การเล่าเนื้อเรื่องไปพร้อมกับรูปภาพประกอบเพื่อบรรยายถึงเหตการณ์ต่างๆที่เกิดขึ้น
                    โดยในเกมเราจะสามารถเลือกตัวเลือกหรือมีประติสัมพันธ์ตัวละครเพื่อดำเนินเนื้อเรื่องและเข้าใจถึงเรื่องราว
                    ตัวละครต่างๆ
                    ทางคณะผู้จัดทำได้มีความเห็นว่ามีความน่าสนใจจึงได้ริเริ่มโครงงานการสร้างเกมแนว visual novel

                    class="textcontent">หลังจากที่เราสามารถกำหนดหัวข้อโครงงานและแนวเกมได้แล้วจึงเริ่มต้นกำหนดประเภทของเนื้อเรื่อง
                    ว่าจะให้มีเนื้อเรื่องเป็นอย่างไร
                    มีแนวทางการดำเนินเนื้อเรื่องเป็นอย่างไรจึงได้ผลสรุปออกมาว่าจะทำเป็นแนวเกมผี
                    โดยกำหนดให้ตัวละครในเนื้อเรื่องอยู่ในช่วงมัธยมปลายที่ใกล้จะเรียนจบม.ปลาย
                    มีความอยากรู้อยากลองในการชวนกันไปล่าท้าผีตามประสาวัยรุ่น
                    และได้เจอเรื่องราวแปลกประหลาดมากมายภายในโรงเรียนหลังจากที่เข้าไปลองของจนกระทั่ง
                    สามารถรอดพ้นจากเหตการณ์ต่างๆกลับไปได้<br></span>

                    โดยแบ่งแยกส่วนของเนื้อเรื่องเป็นActในแต่ละ
                    Actก็จะมีเนื้อเรื่องที่ต่อกันและเป็นลำดับๆ
                    เมื่อเขียนเนื้อเรื่องเสร็จแล้วก็เขียนEventหรือเหตการณ์ทางเลือกต่างๆที่ผู้เล่นจะต้องเลือกให้ตัวละครในเกมเพื่อดำเนินเนื้อเรื่อง
                    ให้ผ่านพ้นไปได้และดำเนินเนื้อเรื่องต่อไปจนจบ<br></span>
                <span class="textcontent">ต่อมาในท้ายที่สุดคือการดำเนินการสร้างGUIให้เป็นหน้าตาของเกม เพิ่มรูปภาพ
                    จัดเรียบเรียงและตกแต่งโค้ดปรับปรุงให้แล้วเสร็จ
                    หลังจากนี้ก็จะเป็นหน้าที่ของการแก้บัคต่างๆที่เกิดขึ้นและทดสอบการเล่นเกม หากไม่พบข้อผิดพลาดอะไรก็เป็นอันเป็นเสร็จสมบูรณ์<br></span>

                    เปิดเกมก็ไม่สามารถเปิดได้อย่างที่คาดคิด
                    ในท้ายที่สุดแม้ปัญหาเหล่านี้จะถูกแก้ไขแล้วก็ตามแต่ก็ไม่ได้ร้อยเปอร์เซ็นเสมอ<br></span>
